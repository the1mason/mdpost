#### simple markdown renderer
`asp.net` `|` `.net` `|` `web` `|` `mvc` 


Simple website for notes and blogs. Uses .md for markup and dynamically renders them as .html pages.  
I wanted to host a simple static markdown renderer for my website, but there's actually ZERO simple solutions so I decided to make one. Code is not really production ready. There's some hardcoded values and bad practices, but it's just works as it should.
Application uses [Westwind.AspNetCore.Markdown](//github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.AspNetCore.Markdown) renderer and .NET Core runtime.
