# üêπ Welcome to MdPost!
##### Change index.md file (`wwwroot/posts/index.md`) to change this page view
____

#### [Check out new syntax highlighting feature](/code)

#### Now supports dark theme `bugs included üòÖ`

#### **Useful links**  
- [Markdown syntax](//www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [GitHub repo](//github.com/the1mason/mdpost)
      
#### **Add your first post**  
- Create `<filename>.md` file in `wwwroot/posts/`
- Now you can check this file visiting `website.com/<filename>`

##### **You can use nested folders!**
- Create any folder
- Add markdown file
- Done!
- There's no index pages for folders. For example: to get to `website.com/projects/project1` you should have `project1.md` file located in `wwwroot/posts/projects/project1` but if you want to get to `website.com/projects` you should have `projects.md` file in `wwwroot/posts` directory.

#### **Configute application**
- Go to application folder
- Edit vconfig.json file
